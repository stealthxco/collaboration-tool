# 🚀 Mission Control Deployment - Thread Continuation

## **PROMPT FOR NEW THREAD:**

---

I need you to complete the Mission Control Railway deployment that's 95% finished but failing on the final build step.

**Context**: We've spent ~8 hours building a Mission Control collaboration tool and it's ready to deploy, but the Railway Docker build keeps failing with a `fastq` module dependency issue.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ All code ready in `stealthxco/collaboration-tool` repository
- ✅ Railway authenticated as `mrmayorburd@protonmail.com`  
- ✅ PostgreSQL database provisioned and configured
- ✅ All TypeScript/dependency issues resolved (builds locally)
- ❌ Docker build failing: `Error: Cannot find module 'fastq'`

**Target Deliverable**:
- Working production URL: `https://backend-production-8669.up.railway.app`
- Login credentials: `drew_admin` / `DrewMC2026!`
- Functional API with authentication, health checks, mission management

**Repository Access**: 
1. `cd /Users/mrmayor/.openclaw/workspace/collaboration-tool`
2. Read `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` for complete technical context
3. Follow `IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md` for specific debugging approach

**Key Context**: This is NOT a code issue - the app works locally. This is purely a Railway Docker dependency resolution problem. Focus on deployment configuration, not application code.

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes to complete (just need to resolve the build configuration)

Please start by reading the `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` file in the repository and proceed with the Railway deployment completion.
